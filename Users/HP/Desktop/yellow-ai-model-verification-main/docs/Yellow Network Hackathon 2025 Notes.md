# Yellow Network Hackathon 2025 Notes

# You are participating in the Yellow Network Hackathon Singapore 2025. Please read all important hackathon information in paste.txt and image.jpg before working on the following task: Please perform critical deep dive research (including existing prototypes and/or products in the market, across each of the five hackathon tracks shown in the image.jpg file attached), and then from there please critically analyze and examine what are the current problems/limitations (for each of the five hackathon tracks) that existing ideas/solutions are currently unable to address, and also identify which significant areas of potential that a potential new/novel idea/solution can seek to address (you do not need to come up with a new idea/solution just yet) as of 17 Sep 2025.

Based on my comprehensive research, I now have sufficient information to analyze the five hackathon tracks. Let me create the analysis report.

# **Critical Deep-Dive Research Analysis: Yellow Network Hackathon 2025 Track Opportunities \& Limitations**

## **Executive Summary**

This analysis examines the five hackathon tracks for the Yellow Network Singapore 2025 Ideathon, identifying current market limitations and untapped opportunities across **AI \& Microservices**, **Crowdfunding \& Commerce**, **Fintech, Auctions \& Trading**, **Gaming \& Skill Proof**, and **RWA \& DeFi**. Research reveals significant gaps in existing solutions that Yellow's state channel technology can address, particularly around real-time processing, gasless transactions, and cross-chain interoperability.

# okay, from here, let's critically analyze and examine possible novel-cum-innovative ideas (that we can think of; for each of the five tracks; and rank these ideas accordingly based on each of the evaluation criteria shown below)

Problem Statement
About the Nitrolite SDK \& the Nitrolite Protocol
The Nitrolite Protocol is a chain-agnostic, high-performance development toolkit built by Yellow to simplify and accelerate the creation of Web3 apps. At its core are ERC-7824 state channels, which allow developers to move interactions off-chain while maintaining security, auditability, and final settlement on-chain.
Instead of forcing every action through expensive, slow blockchain calls, Nitrolite abstracts away the complexity — enabling real-time, gasless user experiences that feel like Web2, but are trustless and verifiable.
What you’ll be building?
At this ideathon, your mission is to integrate the Nitrolite SDK to build scalable Web3 products where state channels are used to:
Handle frequent user interactions (e.g., gameplay, payments, bidding) off-chain
Create gasless, low-latency, and chain-abstracted UX
Show real-world value in DeFi, gaming, fintech, AI, prediction markets, or anything else that benefits from speed, scale, and simplicity
To qualify, projects must include
Technical Documentation (PDF/PPT)
Demo Video (2-5 min)
Active Project URL (if applicable)
Code Repository (GitHub, GitLab, etc.)
Fast track selection
Submit your idea early to receive quick feedback and more time to refine your project.
High-impact solutions using the real Yellow \& Nitrolite SDK will gain priority consideration.
Evaluation Criteria
Projects will be assessed based on the following key factors:

- Use the Nitrolite SDK for off-chain logic - (ERC-7824)
- Creativity \& Innovation - Does the project introduce fresh and original ideas?
- Technical Execution - Is the implementation robust, functional, and efficient?
- Real-World Utility - Does the solution address a significant problem effectively?
